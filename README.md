# DAHN Project

## Digital Edition of historical manuscripts (correspondences)

The DAHN project is a project between the University of the Mans, the EHESS and INRIA, and with the partnership of the Ministry
                        of Higher Education, Research and Innovation. Its goal is to create a program for digital scientific edition of corpus of
                        letter exchanges, with, as a basis, the correspondence of Paul d’Estournelles de Constant, senator of Sarthe and 1909 Nobel
                        Peace Prize. The work is to be made in two steps : first, refreshing an already existing numeric environment to let in that
                        new edition. Then, adding the correspondence of d’Estournelles, while documenting the methodology and the actions made. The
                        first editorial platform (from [Lettres et Textes](https://www.berliner-intellektuelle.eu)) was first
                        developed between 2010 and 2016 and enabled the creation of a data model that combines genetic edition and named entities
                        network. Though on a precise subject, it was thought to be a generic tool that allows transverse research on egodocuments and
                        printed corpus, from every modern or contemporary period and in all imaginable European situations on those periods.

## Content of the repository

This repository contains all the files related to the DAHN Project and the correspondance of Paul d’Estournelles de Constant.

It is divided into two folders:
- **Correspondence**: it contains all the files related to the corpus (guidelines, indexes and corpus)
- **Project development**: it contains all the files involved in the evolution and the realization of the project (scripts, models, documentation, etc.). The training files are put into specific folders, depending on whether they are for segmentation or transcription. The scripts are indexed according to the part of the process they belong to : correction, encoding or transcription. A folder containing several documentation explaining how to use most of the scripts has also been created.
