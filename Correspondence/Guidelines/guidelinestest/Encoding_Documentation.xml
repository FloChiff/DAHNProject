                    <head>The project</head>
                    <p>The DAHN project is a project between the University of the Mans, the EHESS and INRIA, and with the partnership of the Ministry
                        of Higher Education, Research and Innovation. Its goal is to create a program for digital scientific edition of corpus of
                        letter exchanges, with, as a basis, the correspondence of Paul d’Estournelles de Constant, senator of Sarthe and 1909 Nobel
                        Peace Prize. The work is to be made in two steps : first, refreshing an already existing numeric environment to let in that
                        new edition. Then, adding the correspondence of d’Estournelles, while documenting the methodology and the actions made. The
                        first editorial platform (from <ref target="https://www.berliner-intellektuelle.eu">Lettres et Textes</ref>) was first
                        developed between 2010 and 2016 and enabled the creation of a data model that combines genetic edition and named entities
                        network. Though on a precise subject, it was thought to be a generic tool that allows transverse research on egodocuments and
                        printed corpus, from every modern or contemporary period and in all imaginable European situations on those periods.</p>

                    <head>About this document</head>
                    <p>This document describes the encoding guidelines and decisions that were made specifically for our project and our editions. It
                        is not a replacement for the original TEI documentation. Rather, it focuses on the way we use TEI elements in order to fit
                        every phenomenon we need to encode. For this reason, only elements that we actually use are described together with exact
                        details on how we use them.</p>
                </div>

            <div>
                <head>Document Encoding</head>
                <p>This TEI encoding must be adapted to the document format we are going to use on the platform created for the project: ego document.
                    Ego documents are written personal documents such as diaries, memoirs or wills. They usually are dated and signed, which will
                    required some recurrent elements on the encoding.</p>
                <p>For each manuscript, a single XML document is created. This part describes elements appearing in those documents including header
                    and body.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>The header</head>
                    <div>
                        <head>
                            <gi>teiHeader</gi>
                        </head>
                        <p>As usual, the header comprises the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element. Following the TEI guidelines, the <gi>fileDesc</gi> (the
                            main characteristics of the document), <gi>encodingDesc</gi> (editorial rules), <gi>profileDesc</gi> (information about
                            the content) and <gi>revisionDesc</gi> (the history of the encoding) elements are used in <gi>teiHeader</gi>. Inside the
                            header, descriptions are given in French or English, and German where appropriate.</p>
                        <div>
                            <head>Creating the <gi>fileDesc</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p>Within <gi>fileDesc</gi>, there are the following elements:
                            <specList>
                                    <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
                                    <specDesc key="publicationStmt"/>
                                    <specDesc key="seriesStmt"/>
                                    <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
                                </specList>
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <head>
                                    <gi>titleStmt</gi>
                                </head>
                                <p>In the mandatory element <gi>titleStmt</gi>, we always encode the title of the document (<gi>title</gi>), authors
                                    and editors (not for letters), and information on its digital version: the funder (<gi>funder</gi>), the head of
                                    the project (<gi>principal</gi>), and, inside as many <gi>respStmt</gi> elements as needed, all other staff
                                    members and contributors who have worked on the digital version of the particular document. In case of letters,
                                    the <gi>title</gi> is structured as follows: “Letter from + name of the sender + to + name of the addressee +
                                    (place, date)”. For example:</p>
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;title xml:lang="en"&gt;Letter from Ludwig Tieck to Friedrich von Raumer (Ziebingen, 30 March 1815)&lt;/title&gt;
                                </egXML>
                                <p>In some case, the letter can be numbered by the sender. It is possible to add that number onto the title, which
                                    then would be structured as follows : ”Letter number + number of the letter + from + [...]”.</p>
                                <p>In case of other manuscripts, the <gi>title</gi> element contains the title as written on the manuscript or given
                                    in another form.</p>
                                <p>For letters, we do not use the <gi>author</gi> element. Instead, the sender and the addressee are encoded in
                                        <gi>correspDesc</gi> inside <gi>profileDesc</gi>.</p>
                                <p>For other types of texts, <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may be used. We have decided to use <gi>editor</gi>
                                    only for roles belonging to the original text, i. e. roles that have led to the original text as it is. The role
                                    is specified in the <att>role</att> attribute of <gi>editor</gi>. For roles of digital edition project members, we
                                    use <gi>respStmt</gi> (see below).</p>
                                <p>If there is more than one author or more than one person with the same role, then their names are grouped inside
                                    one <gi>author</gi> or <gi>editor</gi> element, respectively. These are examples of our intended use of the
                                        <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> elements:
                                    <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                        &lt;author&gt;

                                        &lt;/author&gt;
                                        &lt;editor role="annotator"&gt;
                                            &lt;persName ref="#p0002"&gt;Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder&lt;/persName&gt;
                                            &lt;persName ref="#p0003"&gt;Another annotator&lt;/persName&gt;
                                        &lt;/editor&gt;
                                        &lt;editor role="literary_executor"&gt;
                                            &lt;persName ref="#p0004"&gt;Rudolf Köpke&lt;/persName&gt;
                                        &lt;/editor&gt;
                                    </egXML>
                                </p>
                                <p>The <gi>funder</gi> element must contains the name of the person or organism that finance the project.</p>
                                <p>The <gi>principal</gi> element must contains the name of the person responsible for the creation of the encoding.
                                    It contains detailed elements (forename, surname, and the complete address of the affiliation). </p>
                                <p>The next item <gi>respStmt</gi> comprises the declaration of all persons who took part in the research and edition
                                    of the encoded document. We have selected five different responsibilities: “edited by”, “prepared by”, “in
                                    collaboration with”, “with help from” and “digitization by”. </p>

                                </head>
                                <p>The <gi>publicationStmt</gi> element typically contains all information about the publisher, the publication place
                                    and date and the restrictions of its use. In this project, we only use <gi>availability</gi> and
                                    <gi>date</gi>.</p>
                                <!-- It can be useful to put a publisher or to declare it. Otherwise, the XML-TEI file will be invalid.-->

                                </head>
                                <p>The <gi>seriesStmt</gi> element groups information about the series which the document belongs to. It would
                                    coincide with the name of one of our two projects the documents are link to, either “Letters and texts from
                                    intellectual Berlin around 1800” or "Correspondence of Paul d'Estournelles de Constant". We also specify genre and
                                    topic of each document. To do so, we use <att>type</att> attributes with the values <val>main</val> for the name
                                    of the edition, <val>genre</val> for genre and <val>topic</val> for topic. Genre and topic may appear more than
                                    once. For example:
                                    <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                        &lt;seriesStmt&gt;

                                            &lt;title type="genre"&gt;Letters&lt;/title&gt;
                                            &lt;title type="genre"&gt;Logs/reports&lt;/title&gt;
                                            &lt;title type="topic"&gt;Berlin University&lt;/title&gt;

                                <p> The following element, <gi>sourceDesc</gi>, is used for all metadata describing the sources of the digital
                                    edition. This element is repeatable, so one could describe different sources if one TEI document for the digital
                                    edition is based on several manuscripts. The documents we are encoding are personal documents, letters or others,
                                    handwritten or typescript depending on the period. For this reason, the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element always
                                    contains the sub-element <gi>msDesc</gi>, which is intended for the description of manuscripts. If the manuscript
                                    is a letter, it also contains <gi>correspDesc</gi> to identify the sender and addressee. </p>

                                        <p>In the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, all information concerning the institution, the manuscript’s
                                            collection and its identifier (<gi>idno</gi>) is placed. A <att>type</att> attribute for <gi>idno</gi> can
                                            be used to be more specific about who gave this identifier. It’s necessary to differentiate between the
                                                <gi>repository</gi> and the <gi>institution</gi> element. Institution represents the conservation
                                            place, while repository represents the department in it where the document is preserved. The content has
                                            also been changed in order to be more accurate with the physical adress of the manuscript's institution.

                                    <div>
                                        <head>
                                            <gi>msContents</gi>

                                        <p>The only sub-element of <gi>msContents</gi> is <gi>msItem</gi>. We use it for three different purposes.</p>
                                        <p>First, the document date may be given inside <gi>docDate</gi>. This is the date originally written on the
                                            letter or manuscript by the author<note>If a date was written by a different person, for example by an
                                                archivist, it is not included in <gi>docDate</gi>
                                            </note>. It may be identified as incorrect and thus
                                            differ from the <gi>origDate</gi> (origin date) in the <gi>history</gi> section, where the actual date
                                            (which can be a supposition) is declared. If no date is given on the manuscript, then <gi>docDate</gi> is
                                            left out and only <gi>origDate</gi> appears in the header. If <gi>docDate</gi> and <gi>origDate</gi> are
                                            the same, then both still appear.</p>
                                        <p>Second, <gi>msItem</gi> may be used to give a summary of the manuscript or other details written by a
                                            project member in one or more <gi>note</gi> elements with the <att>resp</att> attribute.</p>
                                        <p>Third, <gi>msItem</gi> may be used to give keywords for the manuscript. They are also included inside
                                                <gi>note</gi> elements—one for each keyword—with <att>resp</att> and
                                                <att>type</att>=<val>keyword</val>.</p>
                                        <p>Here is an example including all three cases :
                                            <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                                &lt;msContents&gt;

                                                        &lt;docDate when="1919-02-04"/&gt;
                                                        &lt;note resp="#floriane.chiffoleau"&gt;This letter is joined with an annexe&lt;/note&gt;

                                                    &lt;/msItem&gt;
                                                &lt;/msContents&gt;

                                <gi>hyphenation</gi> always has the attribute <att>eol</att>=”<val>hard</val>” which—as specified in the TEI
                                guidelines—describes the way we deal with end-of-line hyphenation (see also the description of <gi>lb</gi>).
                                Furthermore, it needs the attribute <att>rend</att> where we state which is the default hyphenation character in the
                                manuscript, i. e. the one which appears most often (here, the ”sh” means a single hyphen (”-”)). It uses the same
                                values as the <att>type</att> attribute of <gi>lb</gi>. Whenever end-of-line hyphenation occurs with the character
                                specified in <att>rend</att>, then it need not be repeated in <att>type</att> of <gi>lb</gi>. The <att>type</att>
                                attribute of <gi>lb</gi> is only mandatory if the hyphenation character in the specific case differs.</p>
                            <p>Please note that this only applies to end-of-line hyphenation. Hyphenation characters inside a line apart from the
                                single hyphen are treated differently. </p>

                            </head>
                            <p> All line breaks are tagged with the <gi>lb</gi> element. The way we encode end-of-line <gi>lb</gi> hyphenation is
                                described in the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element in the header. When a word is being split at a line break, we leave out
                                the hyphenation character. The text <eg>au développe- ment de la civilisation, est assimilé</eg> thus becomes:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    au développe&lt;lb break="no"/&gt;ment de la civilisation, est assimilé
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>As you can see, we use the attribute <att>break</att>=”<val>no</val>” to denote that there is no new word starting
                                there. In the XML file, there must be no spaces and no line breaks between the <gi>lb</gi> tag and the surrounding
                                letters!</p>
                            <p>However, we retain the information about which hyphenation character is used. For each document, we specify a default
                                end-of-line hyphenation character in the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element, that is the character which is used most often.
                                If the hyphenation character in a specific case differs from the default one, we use the attribute <att>type</att> of
                                    <gi>lb</gi> to denote this. The following values are used for <att>type</att>: 
                                     
                                     
                                        <val>sh</val>: single hyphen (“-”). 
                                     
                                        <val>dh</val>: double hyphen (“=”). 
                                     
                                        <val>us</val>: underscore (“_”) 
                                     
                                        <val>none</val>: no hyphenation character at all in the original text. 
                                 
                            </p>
                            <p>Thus, if the default end-of-line hyphenation character is the single hyphen, but one location of the manuscript reads
                                    <eg>Werd ich denn hier nun end= lich etwas finden?</eg> then it becomes:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                        Werd ich denn hier nun end&lt;lb break="no" type="dh"/&gt;lich etwas finden?</egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>In any case, a hyphenation character is retained at the end of a line if it belongs in the word. Thus, the text
                                &lt;eg&gt;Köln- Ehrenfeld &lt;/eg&gt;becomes <egXML xml:space="preserve">Köln-&lt;lb break="no"/&gt;Ehrenfeld</egXML>
                                    (<att>break</att>=”<val>no</val>” is still used, of course, because there is no beginning of a new word.) In the
                                rare case that the line after the break needs to be indented for whatever reason, values for <att>rend</att> have been
                                defined. Use <tag>lb rend=”indent”</tag> for indentation as such without specifying how deep it is, or
                                    <att>rend</att>=”<val>indent-1</val>”, <att>rend</att>=”<val>indent-2</val>” and so on if you need more than one
                                level of indentation: indent-1 then means lowest, the highest number means highest level of indentation.</p>
                            <p>Another rare case is that a character appears after a line break that is not part of the text. See this example:
                                    <eg>"Les dirigeants du monde ont pensé aux relations entre les "gouvernements ;</eg> Here, a quotation mark
                                appears at the beginning of each line (i. e. after each break), but it is not part of the text and thus must, for
                                example, not appear in a display version . This is indicated by using a special value for <att>rend</att> with
                                    <gi>lb</gi>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;lb rend="after:""/&gt; Les dirigeants du monde ont pensé aux relations entre les&lt;lb rend="after:""/&gt; 
                                    gouvernements ;</egXML>
                                The value “after:"” means that the character “"” appears after the line break. It is also possible to use
                                    <tag>lb rend=”before:X”</tag> for special characters that appear before the line break. Normally, line breaks are
                                only shown in a display version of the transcription (the diplomatic version). In the unusual case where a line break
                                that is marked with <gi>lb</gi> should also be shown in a reading version, <tag>lb rend=”both”</tag> may be used.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <head>Page breaks and facsimilies: <gi>pb</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p> Until the image link is more precise, the only element which refers to the picture is the page break element
                                    <gi>pb</gi>. Each <gi>pb</gi> has a <att>n</att> attribute which indicates the page number. For technical reasons
                                it is required to always start with page number 1. The differing page number of an archivist etc. must be marked up as
                                a note. The <att>facs</att> attribute is used to link to the picture on the server. The first child element of
                                    <tag>div type=”transcription”</tag> must be <gi>pb</gi>!</p>
                            <p>For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;body&gt;
                                        &lt;div type="transcription"&gt;
                                            &lt;pb n="1" facs="00000356.jpg"/&gt;
                                            &lt;opener/&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
                                    &lt;/body&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p> If a word is split at a page break, then the attributes <att>break</att>=”<val>no</val>” and, if necessary,
                                    <att>type</att> are used in exactly the same way as in the <att>lb</att> element for line breaks (see above).
                                Hyphenation characters are also dealt with in the same way as they are in line breaks. See this example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve"> 
                                    Werd ich denn hier nun end &lt;pb n="2" facs="00000357.jpg" break="no" type="dh"/&gt;lich etwas finden?</egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>Catchwords are included inside <gi>fw</gi> with the attribute <att>type</att>=”<val>catch</val>” :
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    Werd ich denn hier nun &lt;fw type="catch"&gt;end-&lt;/fw&gt;
                                    &lt;pb n="2" facs="00000357.jpg"/&gt; endlich etwas finden?</egXML>
                                Hyphenation characters inside catchwords are retained, though.</p>

                            <head>Logical text divisions: <gi>div</gi>, <gi>head</gi>, <gi>trailer</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p>For logical text divisions (sections, subsections and so on), we used nested <gi>div</gi> elements. We do not use the
                                numbered division elements <gi>div1</gi>, <gi>div2</gi> and so on. The first <gi>div</gi> of our document will always
                                have an <att>type</att>=”<val>transcription</val>”, but when appropriate, the subsequent <gi>div</gi> may have the
                                attributes <att>type</att> specifying the type of division and <att>n</att> specifying the number of the division.
                                Heading and trailing elements of the section as appearing in the manuscript are given inside <gi>head</gi> and
                                    <gi>trailer</gi>, respectively. These elements always belong only to the <gi>div</gi> of which they are direct
                                sub-elements. For example, if a correspondence is giving a heading with "”Lettre n°” + number of the letter", this can
                                be encoded in a <gi>head</gi> element, as such :
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;div type="transcription"&gt;
                                        &lt;pb n="1" facs=" .jpg"/&gt;
                                        &lt;head rend="center"&gt;LETTRE N°477&lt;/head&gt; 
                                        ... 
                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>Sometimes, an obvious logical unit of a manuscript can be identified but it has no heading given in the text. In these
                                cases, we can (but do not need to) make up our own heading text. It can be included in <gi>head</gi>, but needs to be
                                inside a <gi>note</gi> with <att>resp</att> :
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;head&gt;
                                        &lt;note type="structure" resp="#johanna.preusse"&gt;2. Akt&lt;/note&gt;
                                    &lt;/head&gt;</egXML>

                            </head>
                            <p> Sometimes, an author has obviously marked a division in the text that, however, does not belong to a logical unit such
                                as section, subsection and so on, and thus cannot be marked using <gi>div</gi> elements. In these cases, we use the
                                generic empty element <gi>milestone</gi> with <att>unit</att>=”<val>none</val>” to mark this division. We do not
                                encode any further assumptions on why the division is there. Often, such divisions are marked in the manuscript using
                                a horizontal rule. In these cases, <att>rend</att>=”<val>horizontal-rule</val>” may be used with <gi>milestone</gi>.
                                Other values of <att>rend</att> may be used as appropriate, for example "<val>curved-horizontal-rule</val>" or
                                    "<val>vertical-rule</val>". </p>

                            <p>According to the TEI guidelines, “<gi>opener</gi> groups together dateline, byline, salutation, and similar phrases
                                appearing as a preliminary group at the start of a division, especially of a letter”. We use the <gi>dateline</gi>
                                element to encode the place and the date of the letter, <gi>salute</gi> for the salutation. In some case, it is also
                                possible to have a title for the letter, which can then be included inside the opener, as it is part of the opening of
                                the letter. For example:

                            <p>Similarly, the TEI guidelines say: “<gi>closer</gi> groups together salutations, datelines, and similar phrases
                                appearing as a final group at the end of a division, especially of a letter”. <gi>salute</gi> may also be used for the
                                final salutations, <gi>signed</gi> for the signature. It is also possible to have a <gi>dateline</gi> at the end of a
                                letter. Postscripts are encoded within the <gi>postscript</gi> element. We only integrate the specified elements in
                                the <gi>closer</gi>, primarily the last salutations. Different (preceding) content in the last paragraph is not part
                                of the <gi>closer</gi>, but of the running text. For example:

                            <p>Our documents are mostly handwritten manuscripts, so they all contain deletions and additions. For these—apart from
                                transpositions (see below)—, we use the element couple of <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi>. If the deletion or addition
                                is made by a different hand than the surrounding text, then these elements are used with the attribute <att>hand</att>

                                        been struck through) 
                                     
                                        <val>dots</val> (if the text was first deleted and then marked to be included again by writing dots below
                                        it; see below for examples of nesting of additions and deletions)

                            <p>In case of footnotes or other margin notes that have a numbered or otherwise labeled anchor in the main text, the
                                attribute <att>n</att> may be used with <gi>add</gi> to give the label. In case of strikethrough text, it is sometimes
                                hard to decide how precise to be when encoding a manuscript. Taking a close look at a manuscript page, one can see in
                                many cases that words are actually not completely strikethrough although they are meant to be because the author of
                                course did not use a ruler for striking out. For high precision, the parts (sometimes only one or two letters) that
                                are actually not strikethrough may be marked using
                                <att>rend</att>=”<val>none</val>”:<egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;del rend="none"&gt;str&lt;/del&gt;&lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;ikethrough text&lt;/del&gt;

                            </p>
                            <p>However, it is left to the encoder to decide whether he really wants to be that precise or simply use
                                    <att>rend</att>=”<val>strikethrough</val>” all the way through. If a passage is stroke out so strongly that it
                                cannot be identified anymore, this is indicated by using <gi>del</gi> in combination with <gi>gap</gi>,
                                    <gi>supplied</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi>. See this example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;&lt;gap reason="strikethrough"/&gt;&lt;/del&gt;</egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>The <gi>subst</gi> element groups a combination of deletion and addition in case they definitely belong together.
                                    <att>hand</att> may also be used with <gi>subst</gi> and then does not need to be repeated inside <gi>del</gi> and
                                    <gi>add</gi>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;subst hand="#annotation"&gt;
                                        &lt;del rend="strikethrough"&gt;ressener&lt;/del&gt;
                                        &lt;add place="above"&gt;resserrer&lt;/add&gt;
                                    &lt;/subst&gt;

                            </p>
                            <p>Sometimes, additions and deletions are nested in themselves: Some text had been added that was (partly) deleted
                                afterwards, or some text had been deleted that was marked for inclusion again afterwards (for example by writing dots
                                below it). For these cases, we use two basic rules<note>For simplicity reasons, <att>rend</att> and <att>place</att>
                                    are missing in the following examples but should always be used, of course.</note>: 
                                    
                                     What is meant to be final, goes outside:  
                                             
                                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">&lt;del&gt;A &lt;add&gt;B&lt;/add&gt; C&lt;/del&gt;</egXML> means that
                                                “A C” was written first, then “B” was added in its middle, then everything was deleted. 
                                             
                                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">&lt;del&gt;&lt;add&gt;A&lt;/add&gt;&lt;/del&gt;</egXML> means that “A”
                                                was once written as an addition but then, the whole addition was deleted. 
                                             
                                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">&lt;add&gt;&lt;del&gt;A&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/add&gt;</egXML> means that “A”
                                                was first deleted but then marked as to be included again. 
                                         
                                     
                                     If rule 1 cannot be obeyed, then the attribute <att>seq</att> is used to denote the sequence of the
                                        additions and deletions:
                                        <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                            &lt;add seq="1"&gt;A &lt;del seq="2"&gt;B&lt;/del&gt;C&lt;/add&gt;</egXML>
                                        means that “A B C” was once written as one large addition but then, the “B” part was deleted (and not the
                                        other way round as it would be if there was no <att>seq</att> attribute). 
                                 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <att>seq</att> may use higher numbers in case more than two additions and deletions are nested.</p>
                            <p> Sometimes, additions and deletions may also be nested with (parts of) other elements. If, however, an addition or
                                deletion goes over such (parts of) other elements in a way that <gi>add</gi> and <gi>del</gi> cannot be used with
                                proper XML nesting, <gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> are used with the same attributes and with <gi>anchor</gi>.
                                In the unusual case that something was overwritten but it cannot be told which was first and which is the text that
                                was written over it, <att>seq</att>=”<val>0</val>” is used. See this example where a comma and a dash stand in the

                            <p>Regarding additions on the margin and footnotes, we have encountered some more unusual cases and errors in the
                                manuscripts and describe them like this: 
                                 
                                     If there are two margin note marks in the text but only one note on the page (i. e. if the note could either
                                        belong into this or that place), we use a pointer: In one of the places, we give the <gi>add</gi> element an
                                            <att>xml:id</att> and <att>type</att>=”<val>multiple-anchors</val>” :

                                        there is a <gi>ptr</gi> pointing to the other

                            <p>In some cases, an author has written two or more parts of text which he later decides to give a different order.
                                Sometimes, he does not denote that by deleting the parts and writing them completely again, but by using some mark to
                                denote change of order. For such transpositions, we do not use <gi>subst</gi>, <gi>del</gi> and <gi>add</gi>, but
                                    <gi>transpose</gi>. See this example:

                            <p>The author has first written “dann erst”, but then decided that it should be “erst dann”. The two parts “dann” and
                                “erst” are included in <gi>seg</gi> elements each with an <att>xml:id</att>. Immediately afterwards, follows with a
                                single <gi>transpose</gi> element containing a pointer (<gi>ptr</gi>) to each part in the order that the author has
                                settled on.</p>

                            </head>
                            <p>Sometimes, the hand changes in a way that cannot be dealt with using the <att>hand</att> attribute with some element.
                                For example, if the author had stopped writing at some point and completed the text on another day using different
                                ink, then this change of hand may obviously not be marked as an addition or a note using <gi>add</gi> or
                                <gi>note</gi>. In those cases, we use the empty element <gi>handShift</gi> to denote a shift of hand:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve"> 
                                    This part is written in black ink (default hand).
                                    &lt;handShift new="#red"/&gt; 
                                    This part is written in red ink. </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>The attribute <att>new</att> points to the corresponding <gi>handNote</gi> element in the header, as does
                                    <att>hand</att> within <gi>add</gi>, <gi>note</gi> or other elements. Please note that <gi>handShift</gi> is meant
                                as a switch that is turned at the point where it appears and never goes back to its original position unless another
                                    <gi>handShift</gi> element appears. This means that <gi>handShift</gi> does not obey XML hierarchies. In following
                                example, the hand “<val>#red</val>” runs until the second <gi>handShift</gi> element appears and does not stop at the
                                closing <gi>hi</gi>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">

                                     - is the single hyphen (“-”). 
                                     ⹀ is the double hyphen (“=”, not the equal sign) 
                                     – <!--or &ndash;--> is the en-dash (“–”, German “Gedankenstrich”). 
                                     — <!-- or &mdash;--> is the em-dash (“—”). 
                                     − <!--or &minus;--> is the mathematical minus sign. 
                                  End-of-line hyphenation is treated differently. See below for an explanation of the difference between the
                                numerical and the letter-based (entity) references for the dashes and the minus sign. </p>

                            <p>Every character available in Unicode can be typed in as-is because all our XML documents are UTF8-encoded. If, however,
                                an encoder cannot type in a character because it is not available on their keyboard, two means of referencing it are
                                possible:  
                                     XML numeric character reference <!--&#nnnn;--> where nnnn are up to four decimal digits describing the
                                        Unicode code point of the character. 
                                     XML character entity reference <!--&abcde;--> where abcde are letters. We use the character entity
                                        references defined in HTML, although they are not part of XML nor TEI. Currently, we have not defined these
                                        entities in our schema so our documents are not technically valid during editing, but the entity references
                                        are transformed into numeric references before publication. 
                                  The full list of special characters is given in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/                                     List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references</ref>

                            <p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element with the attributes <att>cert</att> and <att>reason</att> is used for passages that are
                                difficult to read:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;unclear cert="medium" reason="stain"&gt;nur&lt;/unclear&gt;</egXML>
                                Sometimes, it happens that a hard-to-read passage could be either this or that. In those cases, <gi>unclear</gi> can
                                be used with <gi>choice</gi>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    der &lt;choice&gt;
                                        &lt;unclear reason="illegible" cert="high"&gt;den&lt;/unclear&gt;
                                        &lt;unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"&gt;dem&lt;/unclear&gt;
                                    &lt;/choice&gt; Derwisch</egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>Here, it is recommended to use <att>cert</att> to give one possible version a high and the other one a low certainty.
                                    <att>cert</att>=”<val>high</val>” here means, however, that there is a high likelihood for the passage to be the
                                version described—and not that the certainty of unclarity was high. The same goes for
                                <att>cert</att>=”<val>low</val>”, respectively. When the editor could not decide to give one version a higher
                                possibility than the other one, <att>cert</att>=”<val>medium</val>” may be used twice, but this is not recommended.
                                For illegible passages or when a piece of text is missing, we use the <gi>gap</gi> element. It uses the attributes
                                    <att>extent</att> to denote the length of the missing part and <att>reason</att> as does <gi>unclear</gi>, but is
                                an empty element(<note>As opposed to <gi>unclear</gi>, it is mandatory for <gi>gap</gi> to have <att>extent</att>
                                    specified. For <gi>unclear</gi>, the extent can usually be seen from the text that it includes. In rare cases,
                                    however, <att>extent</att> may also be given for <gi>unclear</gi>, for example when it is unsure whether the
                                    unclear part is actually 3 or 4 characters long.</note>):
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">&lt;gap extent="two words" reason="illegible"/&gt;</egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>If the editor decides that he knows or can guess the text that is missing, then he may use <gi>supplied</gi> instead of
                                    <gi>gap</gi> to supply the missing text. <gi>supplied</gi> has the same attributes as <gi>unclear</gi>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">leur &lt;supplied reason="stain"&gt;raison&lt;/supplied&gt; fait
                                    </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>The difference between <gi>unclear</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> is that the first is used when the text is hard to read
                                but still legible and the latter is used as a replacement for <gi>gap</gi> when the text is completely illegible or
                                missing. The following values for <att>reason</att> in <gi>unclear</gi>, <gi>gap</gi> and <gi>supplied</gi> are
                                currently recognized in the web interface and translated automatically into German and French for display:

                            <p>Do not confuse <gi>gap</gi> with <gi>space</gi>! <gi>gap</gi> is for parts containing text that cannot be transcribed,
                                    <gi>space</gi> is for space found in a line deliberately placed there by the writer.</p>

                            <p>We only use the <gi>hi</gi> element, which, according to the TEI guidelines, “marks a word or phrase as graphically
                                distinct from the surrounding text”. A change of scripture is indicated with <gi>hi</gi>, too (for example if one word
                                is written in “Latin” and the rest of the text in “Kurrent” scripture). We add the <att>rend</att> attribute which can
                                adopt several values. For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">&lt;hi rend="underline"&gt;ils ont oublié les relations entre les peuples !&lt;/hi&gt;</egXML>

                            <p>The following values are recommended for <att>rend</att>:  
                                     
                                        <val>underline</val> (with <att>n</att> indicating how often the word is underlined; if n=1, then it may be
                                        left out)

                                that has written the highlighted text. <att>hand</att> corresponds with <gi>handNote</gi> in header as it does in the

                            </head>
                            <p>We place dates in a <gi>date</gi> element and add a standardized form. Two examples:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                &lt;date when-iso="1823-10-06"&gt;den 6t October. 23&lt;/date&gt;
                                &lt;date when-iso="1824/1825"&gt;1824-1825&lt;/date&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <head>Named entitites: Persons, organizations, places, works</head>
                            <p>Every time, a name of a person, an organization, a place or a work appears in a text, it gets marked using
                                    <gi>persName</gi>, <gi>orgName</gi>, <gi>placeName</gi> or <gi>title</gi>, respectively. For every such entity, an
                                entry in the corresponding index is created including an <att>xml:id</att> that has a specific format. From inside the
                                text, the name is linked with the index entry using the <att>ref</att> attribute which points to the corresponding
                                    <att>xml:id</att>. For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;placeName ref="#l0003"&gt;Dresden&lt;/placeName&gt;
                                    &lt;orgName ref="#o0001"&gt;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin&lt;/orgName&gt;
                                    &lt;persName ref="#p0003"&gt;Sofokles&lt;/persName&gt;
                                    &lt;title ref="#w0010"&gt;Nachgelassene Schriften und Briefwechsel&lt;/title&gt;
                                    </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p>However, it sometimes happens that the author writes about a person, an organization, a place or a work without quoting
                                their name. We can’t use the elements <gi>persName</gi>, <gi>orgName</gi>, <gi>placeName</gi> or <gi>title</gi> in
                                those cases, because there is neither a name nor a title. Instead, the <gi>rs</gi> (“referencing string”) element can
                                be applied:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;rs ref="#p0002"&gt;Bruder&lt;/rs&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <head>Parts in different language: <gi>foreign</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p>The majority of the documents is written in German or French. We specify the document’s languages in the
                                    <gi>profileDesc</gi> as part of the TEI header.</p>
                            <p> To denote the actual parts of the text written in another language than its main language, we add an
                                    <att>xml:lang</att> attribute to the correspondent element (<gi>div</gi>, <gi>p</gi>, <gi>hi</gi>, ...). If there
                                is no element directly corresponding with the change of language, we use the <gi>foreign</gi> element with
                                    <att>xml:lang</att> as its attribute.</p>
                            <p>As defined in the XML standard, value of the attribute is the code of the language according to IETF’s BCP 47. In our
                                case, it usually has only one part—the code of the language according to ISO 639. For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;foreign xml:lang="la"&gt;malus&lt;/foreign&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>

                            </head>
                            <p>The wording of stamps on the document can be marked up with the <gi>stamp</gi> element in the body. For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                &lt;stamp&gt;Litteraturarchiv Berlin.&lt;/stamp&gt;
                            </egXML>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <head>Using the <gi>note</gi> element</head>
                        <div>
                            <head>Notes: <gi>note</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p>We distinguish two types of notes—but use the <gi>note</gi> element for both of them.</p>
                            <p> On the one hand, there are notes that appear on the manuscript page. They can be written by the author/sender himself,
                                by a publisher, by an archivist, and so on. We use the attribute <att>hand</att> to link them to a hand that is
                                described in a <gi>handNote</gi> element. The <att>place</att> attribute can adopt the same values as it can in the
                                    <gi>add</gi> element. Signatures of archives are marked using the <att>type</att> attribute.</p>
                            <p> On the other hand, there are notes that we write ourselves. They do not appear on the manuscript page, of course. For
                                these notes, we do not use <att>hand</att>, but <att>resp</att> to link the note with the person that has written it,
                                i.e. with their entry in the index of contributors. If a note written by us should appear only in one of the two
                                display versions in the web interface, this may be indicated using <att>subtype</att>:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;note resp="#sabine.seifert" subtype="1"&gt;only in version 1 (Diplomatic version)&lt;/note&gt;
                                    &lt;note resp="#sabine.seifert" subtype="2"&gt;only in version 2 (Reading version)&lt;/note&gt;
                                </egXML>
                            </p>
                            <p> Both the <gi>note</gi> and the <gi>add</gi> element may describe additions. As it is difficult to know how to
                                distinguish between cases where <gi>note</gi> should be used and cases where <gi>add</gi> should be used, we have
                                decided that this cannot be told for the whole edition and thus settled on making this decision dependent on the
                                habits of each author—except for two project-wide rules:  
                                     If an addition directly and definitely belongs together with a deletion, then <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi> and
                                            <gi>subst</gi> are always used. 
                                     For margin notes (those with <att>place</att>=”<val>margin</val>” and so on), <gi>add</gi> is used if the
                                        addition has a determinable anchor in the text, i. e. if it gramatically and/or semantically belongs into a
                                        certain position in the text that can be clearly identified. Otherwise, then <gi>note</gi> is used. 
                                 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <head>Foliation numbers: <gi>note</gi>
                            </head>
                            <p>We also use the <gi>note</gi> element to denote foliation numbers found on the manuscript page or made by us (e. g. if
                                the foliation on the manuscript is wrong). They are marked using <att>type</att>=”<val>foliation</val>”. As with other
                                notes, they are linked with <att>hand</att> or <att>resp</att>, depending on who made them. For example:
                                <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                    &lt;note type="foliation" hand="#red"&gt;Foliation number on the manuscript page&lt;/note&gt;
                                    &lt;note type="foliation" hand="#pencil"&gt;Other foliation number on the manuscript page&lt;/note&gt;
                                    &lt;note type="foliation" resp="#johanna.preusse"&gt;A foliation made by us&lt;/note&gt;

                            <p> Furthermore, the <gi>note</gi> element may be used with <att>type</att>=”<val>structure</val>” to denote numbers or
                                other means of text structuring in a logical way :

                <p> The digital edition includes five indexes:  
                         index of persons 
                         index of organizations 
                         index of places

                         index of contributors (to the digital edition) 
                      One XML document is created for each of the indexes. This is the skeleton of each of the index documents:

                        </p>
                        <p>Apart from the name, we encode the following information on persons inside a <gi>person</gi> element: 
                                 information on birth using <gi>birth</gi> with <gi>date</gi> and <gi>placeName</gi> inside. 
                                 information on death using <gi>death</gi> with <gi>date</gi> and <gi>placeName</gi> inside. 
                                 sex using <gi>sex</gi> with <tag>sex value=”1”</tag> for a male person and <tag>sex value=”2”</tag> for a female
                                    person. 
                                 occupations using the <gi>occupation</gi> element. Any kind of occupation or profession can be encoded here.
                                    Thus, <gi>occupation</gi> may appear more than once. 
                                 affiliations using the <gi>affiliation</gi> element. 
                                 
                                    <gi>orgName</gi> can be used inside this element in order to denote the name of an organization and to provide a
                                    pointer to the corresponding entry in the index of organizations. <gi>placeName</gi> may also be used if
                                    appropriate. <gi>affiliation</gi> can appear more than once. 
                                 educational experiences using the <gi>education</gi> element. Inside, <gi>placeName</gi> and <gi>orgName</gi>
                                    can be used, too, when appropriate. <gi>education</gi> can appear more than once. 
                                 other events related to that person using the <gi>event</gi> element. 
                                 
                                    <p>authority file number using the <gi>idno</gi> element to reference the person mentionned. Among the authority
                                        file available, you can for example choose the <ref target="https://www.dnb.de/DE/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html">PND Number</ref> which is
                                        maintained by the German National Library or the <ref target="http://viaf.org">VIAF</ref>, which is an
                                        international authority file operated by the Online Computer Library Center.</p>
                                 
                             
                        </p>
                        <p>For every element, we can use the attribute <att>cert</att> to indicate the degree of certainty associated with its
                            content. We use the values <val>high</val>, <val>medium</val> and <val>low</val>. When no <att>cert</att> attribute is
                            given, this means that the content is definitely certain.</p>
                        <p>Dates are encoded inside <gi>date</gi> with the appropriate attributes according to the guidelines. Dates inside
                                <gi>birth</gi> and <gi>death</gi> don’t need to be repeated as textual content of the <gi>date</gi> element because
                            for the indices, the textual content is not shown in the web interface anyway.</p>
                        <p>Thus, this is correct:
                            <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                            &lt;birth&gt;&lt;date when-iso="1730-08-19"/&gt;&lt;/birth&gt;
                        </egXML>
                            . . . but this is superfluous:
                            <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                &lt;birth&gt;&lt;date when-iso="1730-08-19"&gt;19. August 1730&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/birth&gt;
                            </egXML>

                        </head>
                        <p>Relationships between persons are encoded using <gi>relation</gi> elements that appear inside one <gi>listRelation</gi>
                            which is included in <gi>listPerson</gi> after all <gi>person</gi> elements. Here are some examples:
                            <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                                &lt;relation name="parent" active="#p0001 #p0002" passive="#p0003 #p0004"/&gt;
                                &lt;relation name="spouse" mutual="#p0001 #p0002"/&gt;
                                &lt;relation name="lover" mutual="#p0001 #p0006"/&gt;
                                &lt;relation name="teacher" active="#p0006" passive="#p0004"/&gt;
                            </egXML>
                            These examples indicate the following: Persons 1 and 2 are parents of persons 3 and 4. Persons 1 and 2 are also married.
                            Person 1, however, has a lover which is person 6. Person 6 is also a teacher of person 4. </p>
                        <p>Names of relations (in the <att>name</att> attribute) can be chosen as appropriate. For reasons of uniformity, we do not
                            use the inverse relationships “child” (use parent instead) and “student” (use teacher instead).</p>

                        <p>It would be better to have two <gi>listOrg</gi> element, containing each a set of organizations. One would contains the

                            organizations linked to the project and its contributors. It would then be all the organizations mentioned in the index of
                            contributors and the organizations mentioned in the metadata, like the institution where a document from the corpus is
                            stored (in the <gi>msDesc</gi>).</p>

                        <p> Inside <gi>org</gi>, there is a <gi>orgName</gi> to specify the name of the organization and it is followed by a
                                <gi>desc</gi> element to present briefly the organization. There is also a <gi>placeName</gi> to localise the
                            organization (the place, the country and the location). Finally, just like for the <gi>person</gi>, there is the
                                <gi>idno</gi> element that links the organization to an authority file. For example

                            is used for “Seminararbeiten” (non-journal papers made in university courses). <att>ref</att> is used if the monographic
                            item itself appears in the index of works and then points to its entry. See the below example of a monographic item for an
                            explanation of further elements that may appear inside <gi>monogr</gi>. Afterwards, <gi>imprint</gi> follows using

                <head>Encoding decisions for the whole edition</head>
                <p>This section describes encoding decisions for certain elements that appear throughout the whole edition, i. e. in manuscripts as
                    well as in indices and <gi>teiHeader</gi>s.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>Dates</head>
                    <p> Dates can appear inside the elements <gi>date</gi>, <gi>docDate</gi> and <gi>origDate</gi>. We always give an ISO-8601-like
                        standardized form like this:
                        <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                            &lt;date when-iso="1823-10-06"&gt;den 6t October. 23&lt;/date&gt;
                            &lt;date when-iso="1824/1825"&gt;1824-1825&lt;/date&gt;
                        </egXML>
                    </p>
                    <p>Inside the indices, there need not be any textual content in most <gi>date</gi> elements because such content is not shown in
                        the web interface anyway.</p>
                    <p>Thus, this is correct:
                        <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                        &lt;birth&gt;&lt;date when-iso="1730-08-19"/&gt;&lt;/birth&gt;
                    </egXML>
                        . . . but this is superfluous:
                        <egXML xml:space="preserve">
                            &lt;birth&gt;&lt;date when-iso="1730-08-19"&gt;19. August 1730&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/birth&gt;
                        </egXML>
                    </p>
                    <p>Because the TEI guidelines allow a number of attributes and ways of encoding a standardized form of the given date, we have
                        decided not to use all of them, but always encode dates in this format:  
                             We always use the attribute <att>when-iso</att> for singular values and give the dates according to ISO 8601, that
                                is to say in the following format: yyyy-mm-dd. 
                             For intervals, we use a slash “/”: <att>when-iso</att>=”<val>1824/1825</val>” means “from 1824 until 1825”. We never
                                use the attributes <att>from-iso</att> nor <att>to-iso</att>. 
                             Intervals within the same year or month are given like this: <att>when-iso</att>=”<val>1824-07/08</val>” means “from
                                July 1824 until August 1824”, <att>when-iso</att>=”<val>1824-07-01/04</val>” means “from 1 August 1824 until 4 August
                                1824”, <att>when-iso</att>=”<val>1824-07-01/08-04</val>" means “from 1 July 1824 until 4 August 1824”. As a rule of
                                thumb, writing intervals like this is only allowed when there are more fields to the left of the slash than to the
                                right of the slash. 
                             
                                <p>Sometimes, there are intervals like “from (some day in) 1824 until 6 June 1825”. It is, however, not allowed to
                                    have more fields to the right of the slash than to the left. In those cases, we adhere to the extensions of ISO
                                    8601 given in the EDTF (Extended Date/Time Format) draft<note target="https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/">https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/</note>. This especially means looking at the following sections.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="bold">Uncertain/Approximate</hi>: The characters “?” and “~” are used to mean “uncertain” and
                                    “approximate” respectively, and in combination, i. e. “?~”, to mean “uncertain” as well as “approximate”. These
                                    characters may occur only at the end of the date string and apply to the entire date. [...]. Exemples :

                                <p>Sometimes it might be impossible to give an exact date, but one can guess, e. g. from the content of a
                                    manuscript, that for example, it cannot be written before a certain date because it refers to something that
                                    happened on that date. For such open-end or open-start cases, we use the <att>notBefore-iso</att> and
                                        <att>notAfter-iso</att> attributes. For cases where a date is one of a set of possible dates, we use
                                        <att>when-iso </att>and adhere to the “One of a Set” proposal in EDTF:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="bold">One of a Set</hi>: Square brackets wrap a single-choice list. A list is represented using commas
                                    and double-dots where a double-dot indicates all the values between the two values it separates, inclusive. [...].
                                    Examples:  
                                         
                                            <val>[1667,1668,1670..1672]</val>: One of the years 1667, 1668, 1670, 1671, 1672

                                <p>Dates may also refer to a different calendar, mainly to the French Revolutionary calendar. The value of
                                        <att>when-iso</att> always has to be in the form of the Gregorian calendar. The <att>calendar</att> attribute
                                    is used to denote that the date refers to another calendar. We use the value <val>“french-rev-cal”</val> for the
                                    French Revolutionary calendar:
